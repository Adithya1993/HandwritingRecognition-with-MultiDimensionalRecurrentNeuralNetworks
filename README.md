# HandwritingRecognition (MultiDimensional RecurrentNeuralNetworks)
Recognize handwritten text in scanned documents using MultiDimensional Recurrent Neural Networks

Creates a network based on [MultiDimensional RNNs](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/nips2009.pdf) architecture using python and cython with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) cost function.
